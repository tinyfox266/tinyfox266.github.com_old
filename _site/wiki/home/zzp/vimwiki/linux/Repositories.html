<h2 id="toc_0.1">Repositoriy Contents</h2>
<p>
A git <strong>repository</strong> contains, among other things, the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A set of <strong>commit objects</strong>

<li>
A set of references to commit objects, called <strong>heads</strong>

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.2">Commit Objects</h2>
<p>
A <strong>commit object</strong> contains three things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A set of <strong>files</strong>, reflecting the state of the project at a given point in
      time.

<li>
References to <strong>parent commit objects</strong>.

<li>
An <strong>SHA1 name</strong>, a 40-character string that uniquely identifies the commit
      object. The name is composed of a hash relevant aspects of the commit, so
      identical commits will always have the same name.

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.3">Heads</h2>
<p>
A <strong>head</strong> is simply a reference to a commit object. Each head has a name. By
default, there is a head in every repository called <strong>master</strong>. A repository can
contain any number of heads. At any given time, one head is selected as the
"current head". This head is aliased to <em>HEAD</em>, always in capitals.
</p>

<p>
Note this difference: a "head" (lowercase) refers to any one of the named heads
in repository; "HEAD" (uppercase) refers exclusively to the current active head.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.4">A Simple Repositoriy</h2>
<p>
To create a repository:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>git init</code>

</ul>

<p>
To create a commit
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tell Git which files to include in the commit, with <code>git add</code>. If a file
      has not changed since the previous commit (the "parent" commit), Git will
      automatically include it in the commit you are about to perform. Thus, you
      only need to add files that you have added or modified. Note that it adds
      directories recursively, so <code>git add .</code> will add everything that has
      changed.

<li>
Call <code>git commit</code> to create the commit object. The new commit object will
      have the current <em>HEAD</em> as its parent (and then, after the commit is
      complete, <em>HEAD</em> will point to the new commit object).

</ul>
      
<p>
 As a shortcut, <code>git commit -a</code>  will automatically add all modified files
 (but not new ones).
</p>
 
<p>
 Other commands that are useful at this point:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>git log</code> shows a log of all commits starting from <em>HEAD</em> back to the
      initial commit

<li>
<code>git status</code> shows which files have changed between the current project
      state and <em>HEAD</em>. Files are put in one of three categories: new files that
      haven't been added (with <code>git add</code>), modified files that haven't been
      added, and files that have been added

<li>
<code>git diff</code> shows the diff between <em>HEAD</em> and the current project state.
      With the <code>--cached</code> option it compares added files against <em>HEAD</em>;
      otherwise it compares files not yet added.

<li>
<code>git mv</code> and <code>git rm</code> mark files to be moved (rename) and removed,
      respectively, much like <code>git add</code>.

</ul>
      

<p>
My personal workflow usually looks like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do some programming.

<li>
<code>git status</code> to see what files I changed.

<li>
<code>git diff [file]</code> to see exactly what I modified.

<li>
<code>git commit -a -m [message]</code> to commit

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.5">Refering to a Commit</h2>
<p>
Now that you¡¯ve created commits, how do you refer to a specific commit? Git
provides many ways to do so. Here are a few:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
By its SHA1 name, which you can get from <code>git log</code>.

<li>
By the first few characters of its SHA1 name.

<li>
By a head. For example, HEAD refers to the commit object referenced by <em>HEAD</em>. 
      You can also use the name, such as <code>master</code>.

<li>
Relative to a commit. Putting a caret (^) after a commit name retrieves the
      parent of that commit. For example, HEAD^ is the parent of the current head
      commit.

</ul>
