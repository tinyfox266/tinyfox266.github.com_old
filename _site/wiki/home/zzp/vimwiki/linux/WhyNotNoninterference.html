<p>
Security properties based on information flow, such as noninterference, provide
strong guarantees that confidentiality and integrity are maintained. However,
there are several reasons why strict noninterference as a security policy may be
undesirable:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sometimes the required policy intentionally permits some amount of
      information flow -- confidentiality may conditionally depend on some other
      factors. For example, Alice may be willing to release her private data to 
      Bob after he pays for it, but not otherwise.

<li>
The policy may require that information be kept secret for only some fixed
      duration. For example, an on-line auction service must release the value
      of the winning bid after the auction closes.

<li>
The rate at which information is intentionally leaked may be considered
      too slow to pose a security threat. For example, a password-checking
      function of an operating system manages on confidential passwords, but
      even denying access reveals tiny amounts of information about the correct
      password.

<li>
Noninterference is the desired policy, but the program analysis is not
      able to justify the security of some operations. For example, the
      encryption function of a cryptographic library takes confidential data and
      makes it public, but the justification that this is secure lies outside
      the analysis of the security type system.

</ul>
