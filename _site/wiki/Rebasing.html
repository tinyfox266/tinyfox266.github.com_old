<p>
Git offers a unique feature called <code>rebasing</code> as an alternative to merging. Its
syntax is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<code>git rebase [new commit]</code>
</blockquote>
    
<p>
When run, Git performs the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Identifies each commit that is an ancestor of the current commit but not of
  [new-commit]. This can be thought of as a two-step process: first, find the
  common ancestor of [new-commit] and the current commit; call this the 
  <em>ancestor commit</em>. Second, collect all the commits between the ancestor commit and the
  current commit.

<li>
Determines what changed for each of those commits, and puts those changes aside.

<li>
Sets the current head to point to [new-commit].

<li>
For each of the changes set aside, replays that change onto the current head and
  creates a new commit.

</ul>
