<p>
A <strong>separation kernel</strong> is a type of security kernel used to simulate a
distributed environment. The concept was introduced by John Rushby in 
a 1981 paper. Rushby proposed the separation kernel as a solution to the
difficulties and problems that had arisen in the development and verification of
large, complex security kernels that were intended to "provide multilevel secure
operation on general-purpose multi-user systems."
</p>

<p>
A variant of the separation kernel, the <strong>partition kernel</strong>, has gained
acceptance in the commercial aviation community as a way of consolidating, onto
a single processor, multiple functions, perhaps of mixed criticality.
</p>

<p>
In 2007 the Information Assurance Directorate of the U.S. National Security
Agency(NSA) published the Separation Kernel Protection Profile(SKPP), a security
requirements specification for separation kernels suitable to be used in the
most hostile threat environments.
It defines the security functional and assurance requirements for the
construction and evaluation of separation kernels while yet providing some
latitude in the choices available to developers.
</p>

<p>
In September 2008, Green Hill's INTEGRITY-178B became the first separation
kernel certified against the SKPP. Wind River Systems has separation kernel
technology that was in active certification process in 2009.
