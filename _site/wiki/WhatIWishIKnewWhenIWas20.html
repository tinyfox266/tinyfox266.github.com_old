The key to need finding is identifying and filling gaps--
that is, gaps in the way people use products, gaps in the services
available, and gaps in the stories they tell when interviewed about
their behavior.

He noticed that parents become terribly embarrassed when asked if their 
child is "still in diapers."
-- How could a diaper become a symbol of success as opposed to failure?
Michael came up with the idea for Pull-Ups, a cross between a diaper 
and underwear. Switching from diapers to Pull-Ups, served as a big milestone
for both children and parents. A child can put on a Pull-Up without help,
and can feel proud of this accomplishment.

If your goal is to make meaning by trying to solve a big problem in

One of worst idea for saving energy is to give each employee a quota for how much 
energy he or she used and to charge extra for executing the alotment.
The team that received this idea turned it into an idea that is really worth considering,
in which employees do have a quota for how much energy they use. If they use less 
they get money back, and if they use more they are charged for it.
They could even sell energy credits to their co-workers, givimg them even larger incentive
to save delectricity.
