<p>
In our opinion, to make a crucial point: the two mechanisms
(access control, information flow control) are entirely
<em>unrelated</em>, and should coexist <em>without</em> interacting.
Indeed, access control involves <em>principals</em>, <em>trust</em> and <em>authentication</em>,
while information flow control requires neither. Furthermore, describing
access control usually involves introducing some form of <em>security violation</em>
in the language's semantics, while information flow control does not.
Why? Access control implements a fixed security policy, defined by (P,&gt;&gt;);
it is meaningless in the absence of such a policy. Information flow control,
on the other hand, does make sense even when (L,&lt;&lt;) is left unspecified, 
because it is only a <em>dependency</em> analysis. It does not, fundamentally, 
have anything to do with security, which explains why it can be 
formalized without a notion of security violation.

In these works, the alleged justification for requesting <em>l &lt;&lt; p</em> is as follows.
<em>p</em> tells who may use the value <em>directly</em>, while <em>l</em> tells who may use it 
<em>indirectly</em>, i.e have(possibly) partial access to the information contained 
in it. Because any principals who is granted direct access it thereby granted
indirect access at the same time, requiring <em>l&lt;&lt;p</em> may seem natural. 
We deem it wrong, however, because these notions are really orthogonal:
while <em>p</em> indeed tells <em>who</em> may use the value, <em>l</em> tells <em>which</em> information
it contains. Mixing the two mechanisms yields  a needlessly complex system.
Seperating them makes the system more modular, conceptually simpler, and 
potentially more expressive, since <em>P</em> and <em>L</em> may be distinct.

Myers and Liskov propose a "decentralized" label model which is a subtle mixture
of access control and information flow control. The model also rests on a set of 
principals <em>(P,&gt;&gt;)</em>. A <em>label</em> is a set of tagged <em>policies</em>, where the tag 
carried by every policy is a principals, called <em>readers</em>. Labels form a
pre-order, whose underlying order is a lattice; it is used, as in this paper, 
to perform information flow analysis. However, Myers and Liskov also allow a
number of "safe" declassification operations: a principal <em>p</em> may choose to 
<em>relax</em> the label carried by a given value, by arbitrarily modifying any policy
owned by a principals <em>q</em> which it acts for. Of course, <em>p</em> is not allowed to
affect the policies owned by principals whose trust it has not received. So.
labels do not only carry <em>dependency</em> information; then also contain <em>access control</em>
information, since the use of declassification is restricted.
</p>

<p>
We think Myers and Liskov's model has significant practical interest. However,
we believe that comparable expressive power can be achieved in a theoretically 
simpler systems. Indeed, imagine orthogonal access control and information control,
as suggested above. Then one may selectively allow declassification by
providing, in the initial typing environment, a number of declassification
operations, <em>locked</em> at appropriate levels of authority. The sets of <em>P</em> and <em>L</em>
may, in general, be chosen independently; only the types of declassification
operations provide a connection between the two.
