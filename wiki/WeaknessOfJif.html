Security-typed languages are still in development. The most feature-full
security-typed language, [<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif</a> Jif], provides a 
security-typed variant of much of the Java language. Unfortunately, some
practical tools are lacking in order to use this language to build real-world
systems.
</p>

<p>
It is  found that [<a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/jpmail/jiftools.html">http://siis.cse.psu.edu/jpmail/jiftools.html</a> tools] were
needed in three categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Software engineering</strong>: Developing an application in Jif was complex and
      time-consuming. Just the edit/compile/repair cycle was tedious because of
      the surprisingly large number of possible information leaks in typical
      programs. Jif prevents all possible leaks, forcing very particular
      programming styles. There are also opportunities for other refactoring to
      aid the programmer in labelling and re-labelling data. These developments
      are still in progress.

<li>
<strong>High-level policy construction</strong>: Jif policy consists essentially of 3
      parts: (1) prinpals,(2) delegations, (3) declassifiers. Modelling
      different security environments(a bussiness, research lab, or Military MLS
      system setting, e.g.) should be possible at a high-level. This policy
      should be configurable at the application level rather than only at the
      level of each line of code. No such policy infrastructure exists for Jif.

<li>
<strong>Distributed policy</strong>: Jif aims to be useful for building distributed,
      secure application. This requires that policy be able to remain consistent
      across a distributed framework. Furthermore, Jif applications must be
      able to interact with other components, such as the operating system,
      network, foreign servers, etc. Currently, there is no way to maintain a
      policy across a distributed system involving non-Jif components.

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.1">Jiftools</h2>
<p>
To address the problem above, several tools are proposed:
</p>

</p>

<h3 id="toc_0.1.2">A high-level policy tool for jif</h3>
<p>
Jif lacks a policy management infrastructure. We developed such an
infrastructure consisting of two components: a runtime policy store that
provides dynamic access to principals, and a policy compiler that automatically
generates principals. Our high-level policy tool is based on 
[<a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/jpmail/trusteddeclassification.html">http://siis.cse.psu.edu/jpmail/trusteddeclassification.html</a> Trusted Declassification]
The detailed can be seen in 
[<a href="http://siis.cse.psu.edu/jpmail/papers/plas06.pdfTrusted">http://siis.cse.psu.edu/jpmail/papers/plas06.pdfTrusted</a> declassification: High-level policy for a security-typed language]
</p>


<ul>
<li>
Policy store The policy store is a runtime data structure and collection of
      methods that provide for the dynamic look-up of Jif principals by name. The
      policy store contains the collection of principals for a system; each principal
      contains its own policy, (thus the name, "policy" store).

</ul>
<blockquote>
By initializing the policy store at the outset of a program, we can impose a
single policy on a whole program, carefully regulating where (i.e. in which
declassifiers), how and by whom declassifications are allowed to take place.
Furthermore, we have easy access to a central store of dynamic principals that
can be applied to incoming data. Finally, this policy store gives us a starting
point for building a distributed policy store that can govern the policy on a
distributed network of applications.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Policy compiler The Jif tools lack utilities to specify high-level policy. In
      particular, we desire to automatically generate Jif policy infrastructure (code)
      from high level specifications. To this end, we developed a simple policy
      language and an accompanying compiler. Currently, the policy language consists
      of only two types of policy statements: delegations and declassifier-allowances
      (implicitly, there is also the declaration of the principals themselves). 

</ul>
<blockquote>
Policy is integrated into a Jif program by using the policy compiler. The
compiler interprets the policy specification and generates the associated Jif
code. The created code provides functions for the creation of principals (as
identified in the specification) and for their insertion in the policy store.
The policy specification also includes explicit authorizations of all the
declassifiers that the principals trust. Functions for the policy initialization
and principal delegations described in the policy file are also created.
Finally, this automatically generated code is introduced into the Jif
application with a single line of Jif code. 
</blockquote>

      
<h3 id="toc_0.1.3">Distributed policy tools for Jif</h3>

<p>
For Jif-labeled data to pass outside a Jif application and retain its policy,
some special steps must be taken. We provide some tools for extending an
application's policy beyond the application itself. Since most Jif applications
(for the foreseeable future) will need to interact with non-Jif components,
there must be some reliable way to talk about principals and policy outside of a
Jif application. To do this, we provide a policy store for mapping Strings to
principals and some cryptographic tools for maintaining principal identities in
a distributed environment.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Policy Store How should Jif labels and principals be represented outside of Jif
      applications? We chose to represent principals by using their name, stored in a
      String. When a principal re-enters a Jif application, this name must be
      re-associated with the corresponding Jif principal. The policy store maps
      (String) names to Jif principals. The Jif principals, themselves, contain their
      policy (allowed delegations and declassifications). This makes it possible to
      send data outside a Jif application: it can be labeled with a String and then on
      re-arrival in a Jif application, the label can be re-associated with a Jif
      principal.

<li>
<strong>KeyPrincipal</strong> In order to maintain the consistency of principals between
      applications, each principal should be associated with a public key and data
      which passes outside a Jif application should be encoded with the public key for
      that principal. The <strong>KeyPrincipal</strong> class serves to associate a Jif principal with
      a public key. These public keys are read from certificates which have been
      signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). In essence, a distributed system
      of Jif applications should be parameterized by a single CA to ensure principal
      consistency.

<li>
<strong>"Logging in"</strong> This small extension to the Jif runtime system allows a user to
      "log in" to a Jif program as a particular principal. The authentication for this
      login is that the user can provide the private key for the particular principal
      (certified by a particular CA, stored in a local keystore). When the
      authentication is successful, the runtime system can be safely labeled with this
      principal, including the file system and stdin/stdout.

</ul>

<p>
These distributed policy tools are still under construction. Currently, the
policy and certificates are stored in the local file system and must be
synchronized outside of a Jif application. In the future there will be a
distributed policy store from which principals' certificates and policy can be
loaded.
