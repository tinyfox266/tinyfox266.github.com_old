<h2 id="toc_0.1">Merging</h2>
<p>
After you have finished implementing a new feature on a branch, you want to
bring that new feature into the main branch, so that everyone can use it. You
can do so with the git merge or git pull command.
</p>

<p>
The syntax for the commands is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>git merge [head]</code>

<li>
<code>git pull . [head]</code>

</ul>
     
<p>
They are identical in result. (Though the <code>merge</code> form seems simpler for now, the
reason for the <code>pull</code> form will become apparent when discussing multiple
developers.)
</p>

<p>
These commands perform the following operations. Let the current head be called
<code>current</code>, and the head to be merged called <code>merge</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Identify the common ancestor of <em>current</em> and <em>merge</em>. Call it <em>ancestor-commit</em>.

<li>
Deal with the easy cases. If the <em>ancestor-commit</em> equals <em>merge</em>, then do 
      nothing. If <em>ancestor-commit</em> equals <em>current</em>, then do a 
      <strong>fast forward merge</strong>.

<li>
Otherwise, determine the changes between the <em>ancestor-commit</em> and <em>merge</em>.

<li>
Attempt to merge those changes into the files in <em>current</em>.

<li>
If there were no conflicts, create a new commit, with two parents, <em>current</em> and
      <em>merge</em>. Set <em>current</em> (and <em>HEAD</em>) to point to this new commit, and update the
      working files for the project accordingly.

<li>
If there was a conflict, insert appropriate conflict markers and inform the
      user. No commit is created.

</ul>
      
<p>
<strong>Important note</strong>: Git can get very confused if there are uncommitted changes in
the files when you ask it to perform a merge. So make sure to commit whatever
changes you have made so far before you merge.
</p>

<p>
So, to complete the above example, say you check out the <em>master</em> head again and
finish writing up the new data for your paper. Now you want to bring in those
changes you made to the headers.
</p>

<p>
You would run:
</p>
<blockquote>
<code>git merge fix-headers</code>
</blockquote>
    
<p>
If there are no conflicts, the resulting repository looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
          &lt;-----------------(D)-------
         /                   |         \
(A) &lt;-- (B) &lt;------(C) &lt;-------------- (E)
                             |          |
                         fix-headers  master
                                        |
                                       HEAD

</pre>

<p>
<strong>Note on terminology</strong>: When I say ¡°merge head A <em>into</em> head B,¡± I mean that head B
is the current head, and you are drawing changes from head A into it. Head B
gets updated; nothing is done to head A. (If you replace the word ¡°merge¡± with
the word ¡°pull,¡± it may make more sense.)
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.2">Resolving Conflicts</h2>

<p>
A conflict arises if the commit to be merged in has a change in one place, and
the current commit has a change in the same place. Git has no way of telling
which change should take precedence.
</p>

<p>
To resolve the commit, edit the files to fix the conflicting changes. Then run
<code>git add</code> to add the resolved files, and run <code>git commit</code> to commit the repaired
merge. Git remembers that you were in the middle of a merge, so it sets the
parents of the commit correctly.
</p>

<p>
A fast forward merge is a simple optimization for merging. Say your repository looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
                +-- (D) -- (E)
               /            |
(A) -- (B) -- (C)           |
               |            |
            current     to-merge
               |
              HEAD

</pre>

<p>
and you run <code>git merge to-merge</code>. In this case, all Git needs to do is set <em>current</em> to point to (E). Since (C) is the common ancestor, there are no changes to actually ¡°merge.¡±
</p>

<p>
Hence, the resulting merged repository looks like:
</p>

<pre>
                +-- (D) -- (E)
               /            |
(A) -- (B) -- (C)           |
                            |
                    to-merge, current
                                 |
                                HEAD
</pre>

<p>
That is, <em>to-merge</em> and <em>current</em> both point to commit (E), and HEAD still points to <em>current</em>.
</p>

<p>
Note an important difference: no new commit object is created for the merge. Git only shifts the head pointers around.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.3">Common Merge Use Patterns</h2>

<p>
There are two common reasons to merge two branches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
draw the changes from a new feature branch into the main branch.

<li>
draw the main branch into a feature branch you are developing.

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.4">Deleting a Branch</h2>
<p>
To delete a branch, use <code>git branch -d [head]</code>. This simply removes the
specified head from the repository¡¯s list of heads.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important note</strong>: git branch -d will cause an error if the branch to be deleted is
not reachable from another head. 
</p>

<p>
Git does allow you to use the <code>-D</code> option to force deletion of a branch that would
create a dangling commit. However, it should be a rare situation that you want
to do that. <strong>Think very carefully</strong> before using <code>git branch -D</code>.
