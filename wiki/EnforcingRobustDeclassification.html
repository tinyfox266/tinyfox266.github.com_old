        <title>EnforcingRobustDeclassification</title>

        <body>
            
<h3 id="toc_0.0.1">Introduction</h3>
<p>
This paper proposes a type system to enforce 
<em>Robust Declassification</em>.
Additionally,
this paper defines the a language-based definition of 
<em>active attacker</em> 
and a language-based definition of <em>Robust Declassification</em>.
</p>

<p>
This paper connects the confidentiality and the integrity of the program.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_0.0.2">Basic Idea</h3>
<p>
The attacker cannot influence the decision of the declassification.
</p>

<p>
Take the following example:
</p>

<pre>
[.]; if x_LL then y_LH:=declassify(z_HH,LH)
               else Skip
</pre>

<p>
is not robust, because the attacker might affect what is declassifieid or when
it is declassified, by controlling the decision variable x_LL.
</p>

<p>
So only high-integrity variable(which cannot be modified by the attacker)  
can emerge in the guard condition of the
conditional and the loop.
And attacker can only modify the variable which is LL(Low confidentiality, Low
integrity).
</p>

<h3 id="toc_0.0.3">Active Attack</h3>
<p>
Active attack is modelled by a language which can only manipulate on the 
LL(Low confidentiality, Low integrity) variables.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition is shown below:
</p>

\[
\begin{array}{lll}
    a &amp; ::= &amp; \mbox{skip} \\
      &amp; ~|~ &amp;  v:=e(\forall v \in \textit{Vars}(e).\Gamma(x)=l\Gamma(v))
        ~|~   a_1;\ a_2  \\
      &amp; ~|~ &amp; \mbox{if } b \mbox{ then } a_1 \mbox{ else } a_2             
              (\forall x \in \textit{Vars}(b).\Gamma(x)=l) \\
      &amp; ~|~ &amp; \mbox{while } b \mbox{ do } a (\forall x \in \textit{Vars}(b).\Gamma(x)=l)
        
\end{array}
\]

<h3 id="toc_0.0.4">Program</h3>
<p>
A program is composed by two parts:
(i). high-integrity context, which is original program that may contain the
declassification statement;
(ii). low-integrity code, which is the <em>active attack</em> code.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition of high-integrity context is shown below:
</p>
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
    e ::= \textit{val} 
      ~|~ v
      ~|~ e_1 \mbox{ op } e_2
      ~|~ \mbox{declassify}(e,l)
\\[2ex]      
    c[\vec{\bullet}] 
      ::= \mbox{skip}
      ~|~ v:=e
      ~|~ c_1;\ c_2
      ~|~ \mbox{if } e \mbox{ then } c_1 \mbox{ else } c_2
      ~|~ \mbox{while } e \mbox{ do } c
      ~|~ \bullet
\end{array}
\]

<p>
Note that the robustness is really a property of a high-integrity program
context rather than of an entire program.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_0.0.5">Security Type System for Robustness</h3>
<p>
The security type system is used to restrict the 
high integrity context.
The goal for the <em>Robust Declassification</em> is to prevent the declassification
mechanism from abusing by the <em>Active Attacker</em>.
</p>

<p>
The key rule governing uses of declassification states that only high-integrity
data is allowed to be declassified and that declassification might only occur
in a high-integrity context.
</p>

<p>
The formal definition of the declassification typing rules is shown below:
</p>

\[
\Gamma,\textit{pc} \vdash e:l' \quad
l \sqcup \textit{pc} \sqsubseteq \Gamma(v) \quad
I(l) = I(l') \quad
I(\textit{pc}),I(l') \in H_I
\]
<hr />
\[
\Gamma,\textit{pc} \vdash v:=\mbox{declassify}(e,l)
\]
