<h2 id="toc_0.1">Working with Other Repositories</h2>
<p>
A key feature of Git is that the repository is stored alongside the working
copies of the files themselves. This has the advantage that the repository
stores the entire history of the project, and Git can function without needing
to connect to an external server.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.2">Distributed Version Control</h2>
<p>
Say you and your friend want to work on the same paper. Your friend already has
done some work on it. There are three tasks you need to figure out to do so:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
How to get from your friend a copy of the work to date.

<li>
How to get the changes your friend makes into your own repository.

<li>
How to let your friend know about changes you make.

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.3">Copying the Repository</h2>
<p>
To make a copy of your friend's repository for your own use, run 
<code>git clone [remote-specification]</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <em>[remote-specification]</em> identifies the location of your friend's repository,
and it can be as simple as another folder on the filesystem. Where your friend's
repository is accessible by a network protocol such as ssh, Git refers to the
repository by a URL-like name, such as <code>ssh://server/repository</code>.
</p>

<p>
For example, if your friend's repository is located in ~/jdoe/project, you would
run:
</p>

<p>
<code>git clone ~/jdoe/project</code>
</p>

<p>
This would do the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Create a directory <em>project</em> and initialize a repository in it.

<li>
Copy all the commit objects and head references from the project into the new
  repository.

<li>
Add a <strong>remote repository reference</strong> named <em>origin</em> to the new repository, and
  associate origin with <code>~/jdoe/project</code> as described below. (Like <em>master</em>, <em>origin</em> is
  a default name used by Git.)

<li>
Add <strong>remote heads</strong> named <em>origin/[head-name]</em> that correspond to the heads in the
  remote repository.

<li>
Set up one head in the repository to <strong>track</strong> the corresponding
  <em>origin/[current-head-name]</em> head, namely the one that was currently active in the
  repository being cloned.

</ul>
  
<p>
A branch that <strong>tracks</strong> a remote branch retains an internal reference to the
</p>

<p>
If you would like to work with the <em>origin/feature</em> remote branch locally, you
should manually set up a tracking branch. This is done with the following
command:
</p>

<p>
<code>git branch --track [new-local-branch] [remote-branch] remote branch</code>
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.4">Receiving Changes from the Remote Repository</h2>
<p>
After you have cloned the repository, your friend adds new commits to his
repository. How do you get copies of those changes?
</p>

<p>
The command <code>git fetch [remote-repository-reference]</code> retrieves the new commit
objects in your friend's repository and creates and/or updates the remote
heads accordingly. By default, <em>[remote-repository-reference]</em> is <em>origin</em>.
</p>

<p>
Note that your own heads are unaffected. The only difference is that the
remote heads, those starting with ¡°origin/¡±, are updated, and the new commit
objects have been added to the repository.
</p>

<p>
Now, you want to update your master and feature heads to reflect your friend's
changes. This is done with a merge, usually done with git pull. The general
syntax is:
</p>

<p>
<code>git pull [remote-repository-reference] [remote-head-name]</code>
</p>

<p>
This will merge the head named
<em>[remote-repository-reference]/[remote-head-name]</em> into <em>HEAD</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.5">Sending Changes to the Remote Repository</h2>
<p>
Now, say that you make changes to your own repository. You want to send these
changes to your friend's repository.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>git push</code>, logically doing the opposite of pull, sends data to the
remote server. Its full syntax is:
</p>

<p>
<code>git push [remote-repository-reference] [remote-head-name]</code>
</p>

<p>
When this command is called, Git directs the remote repository to do the
following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
 Add new commit objects sent by the pushing repository.

<li>
 Set <em>[remote-head-name]</em> to point to the same commit that it points to on the
  pushing repository.

</ul>
  
<p>
On the sending repository, Git also updates the corresponding remote head
reference.
</p>

<p>
If no arguments are given to <code>git push</code>, it will push all the branches in the
repository that are set up for tracking.
</p>
