<h2 id="toc_0.1">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Security:

</ul>
<blockquote>
Techniquies to control who can access/modify system
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Principal:

</ul>
<blockquote>
Unit of accountability in a sytem (e.g., a user)
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Access Control:

</ul>
<blockquote>
Techniquies to restrict operations to certain principals
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Authentication:

</ul>
<blockquote>
Verification of the identity of the principle making a request
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Authorization:

</ul>
<blockquote>
The granting of a request to a principal
</blockquote>
    
<h2 id="toc_0.2">Attacks on security</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Violation of secrety

<ul>
<li>
Attacker reads data without authorization   

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Violation of integrity

<ul>
<li>
Attacker modifies data without authorization

<li>
E.g., Attacker modifies data on disk

<li>
E.g., Attacker modifies network reply to "read file" request

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Denial of service 

<ul>
<li>
Attacker makes system unavailabel to legitimate users

<li>
Overload the system; cause a deadlock

<li>
Trigger security mechanism (e.g., wrong bank PIN 3 times)

</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.3">Security is a negative goal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Ensure nothing happens without authorization

<ul>
<li>
How do you reason about what a system will not do?

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Must first specify who is authorized to de what

<ul>
<li>
Boils down to a question of specifying policy 

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Trusted computing base (TCB):
  Collection of software upon which security relies

<ul>
<li>
Minimize TCB, less code in which to find security holes

</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.4">Protection mechanisms</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Haredware protection

<ul>
<li>
ROM and/or read-only disks can provide booting

<li>
Processor separates user and kernel code

<li>
User code cannot access devices, write kernel memory,...

<li>
Kernel boundary separates TCB

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Software protection 

<ul>
<li>
Kernel or server sanity-checks and restricts call arguments  

<li>
Bytecode interpreter restricts functionality (e.g., JVM)

</ul>
</ul>
     
<ul>
<li>
Protection of network traffic with cryptography

</ul>
 
<h2 id="toc_0.5">Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Policy: The goal security must achieve

<ul>
<li>
Human intent -- originates from outside the system 

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Often talked about in terms of subjects and objects

<ul>
<li>
Subject: Entity making requests(=principal)

<li>
Object: Abstraction to which access is requested

<ul>
<li>
(e.g., a file, a page of memory, a serial port) 

</ul>
<li>
Each object supports different kinds of access

<ul>
<li>
(e.g., read or write file, change permissions,...)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
         
<ul>
<li>
Access control: Should operation be allowed?

<ul>
<li>
What principal is making the request? (Authentication)

<li>
Is the operation permitted to the principal? (Authorization)

</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.6">Examples of access control</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Unnetworked machine in a locked room

<ul>
<li>
Policy: Only users with keys can access the computer

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
(Don't Overlook old-fashioned solutions if they apply!)
</blockquote>
    
<ul>
<li>
Bank ATM card

<ul>
<li>
Policy: Can only withdraw money if it's in your account

<li>
Authentication: Owner must possess card &amp; know PIN

<li>
Authorization: Database tracks account balances

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Private Unix file (only owner can read)

<ul>
<li>
Authentication: Password to run software as user

<li>
Authorization: Kernel checks permissions bits on file

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Military classified data

<ul>
<li>
If process reads top-secret data, cannot write secret

</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.7">Authentication mechanisms</h2>
<ul>
<li>
User provides password to server

<li>
User proves possession of device (e.g., smart card)

<li>
Cryptographic protocol proves possession of private key

<li>
Biometrics (e.g., fingerprint) -- Oftern misused

<ul>
<li>
Should your laptop send your fingerprint to the server?

</ul>
<li>
Don't forget server-to-user authorization!

<ul>
<li>
Fake login screen or ATM machine gets user's password

</ul>
</ul>
    
    
<h2 id="toc_0.8">Authorization mechanisms</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Access control lists on objects

<ul>
<li>
A list of principals and permitted operations for each  

<li>


</ul>
<li>
Self-Authenticating capabilities

</ul>
 
<ul>
<li>
Signed digital certificates

<ul>
<li>
NYU certifies your status; eb.com allows NYU students

</ul>
</ul>
     
<ul>
<li>
Object access in type-safe language

<ul>
<li>
Authentication: Some procedure returns a pointer to object 

<li>
Authorization: Possession of pointer allows access

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Issues of authorization mechanisms

<ul>
<li>
Can those with access futher delegate access?

<li>
How easy is it to revoke access to an object?

</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.9">Interaction between objects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Must consider any operations could violate policy

</ul>
 
<ul>
<li>
Example: Only professor can change grades

<ul>
<li>
OS refuses write requests from others to grades file

<li>
But can attacker change program professor runs to edit file?

<li>
Can attacker change directory so owner reads different file?

</ul>
</ul>
     
<ul>
<li>
Example: setuid and ptrace (debugger system call)

<ul>
<li>
Ptrace lets one process modify another's memory

<li>
Setuid gives a program more privilege than invoking user

<li>
Don't let process ptrace attach to more privileged process

<li>
But also must disable setuid if execing process ptraced

</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.10">A linux security hole</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Some programs acquire then release privileges

<ul>
<li>
E.g., su user setuid, becomes user if password correct

</ul>
</ul>
     
<ul>
<li>
Consider the following:

<ul>
<li>
A and B unprivileged processes owned by attacker

<li>
A ptraces B

<li>
A executes <code>su user</code> to its own identity

<li>
While <code>su</code> is superuser, B execs <code>su root</code>
      (A is superuser, so this is not disabled) 

<li>
A types password, gets shell, and is attached to <code>su root</code>

<li>
Can manipulate <code>su root</code>'s memory to get root shell

</ul>
</ul>
