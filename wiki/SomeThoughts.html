<ul>
<li>
Communication Channel should be a part of the separation kernel because it is
  the only way provided by the kernel for the application to communicate with
  each other.

<li>
Communication Channel should be audited, so that invalid information flow
  should be prevented. The monitor should be verified that if it satisfies the
  specified security policy.

<li>
Who can specify the security policy? An ordinary user or a privileged user?

<li>
To enforcement the security policy by the monitor, is there need for the
  applications to satisfy some conditions?

<li>
Is there a general model to write a verifiable 
  monitor?
