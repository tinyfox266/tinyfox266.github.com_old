<h1 id="toc_1">Partitioning operating systems</h1>
<p>
In a partitioning operating systems, memory(and possibly CPU time as well) is
divided among statically allocated paritions in a fixed manner. The idea is to
take a processor and make it pretend it is several processors by completely
isolating the subsystems.
</p>

<p>
Hard partitions are set up for each part of the system, and each has certain
amount of memory(and potentially a time slice) allocated to it.
Each partition is forever limited to its initial fixed memory allocation, which
can neither be increased nor decreased after the initial system configuration.
</p>

<p>
Within each partition may be multiple threads or processes, or both, if the
operating system supports them. How these threads are scheduled depends on the
implementation of the OS. A partition will generally support a separate
namespace to enable multi-programming by mapping the program into the partition.
</p>

<p>
If the operating system supports time partitioning, it too is fixed.
For example, in an ARINC 653 partitioning system with just three partitions and
a total major allocation of 100ms per cycle, a fixed cyclic scheduler could be
set to run the first partition for 20ms, then the second partition for 30ms, and
then the third for 50ms.

LynxOS-178 is an 
<a href="http://www.lynuxworks.com/solutions/milaero/arinc-653.php ">ARINC 653 partitioning operating system</a> 
that supports 
<a href="http://www.lynuxworks.com/products/posix/processes.php3">multiple POSIX processes</a>
and multiple address spaces; priority scheduling; priority inheritance; and
priority ceilings within each partition. LynxOS-178 essentially moves the LynxOS
scheduler and operating system up a level into each partition, with a full ARINC
653 partitioning operating system underneath.
