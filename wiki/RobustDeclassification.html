        <title>RobustDeclassification</title>

<h3 id="toc_0.0.1">Introduction</h3>
<p>
This paper introduces a property to describe what kind of declassification is
fine. 
With the corresponding,
a property called <em>Robust Declassification</em> is proposed.
<em>Robust Declassification</em> says that 
an active attacker cannot aquire more information for the program than the 
passive attacker,
even if the program contains declassification statement.
<em>Robust Declassification</em> defines 
a system is <em>robust</em> with repect to what class of active attackers.
This paper does not propose a method to enforce <em>Robust Declassification</em>,
but proves that a secure program(which satisfies the noninterference) 
satisfies the robust declassification,
which means that program combined by two secure programs is still secure.

<h3 id="toc_0.0.2">Some Understanding</h3>
<p>
For the example in Sec3,
the attacker adds some transitions to the system:
</p>
\[
\langle 0,h,p,q,r \rangle 
\mapsto_A
\langle 0,h,h,q,r \rangle
\]
<p>
which means that copy the secret \(h\) into the password \(p\).
The observational equivalence induced on the attacker system 
\(S'\) 
</p>
\[
\begin{array}{c}
    \langle t,h,p,q,r \rangle 
    S'[\approx] 
    \langle t',h',p',q',r' \rangle \\
    \Leftrightarrow \\
    (t=t') \wedge (q=q') \wedge (r=r') \wedge \\
    (t=0 \Rightarrow p=p' \wedge h=h' \wedge p=h' \wedge h=p')
\end{array}
\]

<p>
The reason why the equivalent condition 
is 
</p>
\[
    (t=t') \wedge (q=q') \wedge (r=r') \wedge 
    (t=0 \Rightarrow p=p' \vee h=h' \vee p=h' \vee h=p')
\]
<p>
instead of 
</p>
\[
    (t=t') \wedge (q=q') \wedge (r=r') \wedge 
    (t=0 \Rightarrow p=p' \wedge h=h')
\]
<p>
is that 
the attacker cannot judge that 
whether the secret \(h\) is copied into \(p\).
</p>

<p>
Formally,for the nondeterministic system, two runs from \(\sigma_1\)
and \(\sigma_2\) are equivalent
iff 
for the trace \(\tau_1\) starting from \(\sigma_1\),
there is a trace \(\tau_2\) starting from \(\sigma_2\)
such that 
\(\tau_1 \approx \tau_2\)
and 
vice versa.
</p>

<p>
A more savvy attacker might also toggle \(r\) whether he
copied \(h\) into \(p\), thus indicating that \(p\) does in fact 
contain \(h\). This smarter attack adds these transitions:
</p>
\[
\begin{array}{l}
    \langle 0,h,p,q,0 \rangle
    \mapsto_A     
    \langle 0,h,h,q,1 \rangle
    \\
    \langle 0,h,p,q,1 \rangle
    \mapsto_A     
    \langle 0,h,h,q,0 \rangle
\end{array}
\]

<p>
The equivalence relation induced by \(S'\) now is given by:
</p>
\[
\begin{array}{l}
    \langle t,h,p,q,r 
    S[\approx]
    \langle t',h',p',q',r' \\
    \Leftrightarrow \\
    (t=t') \wedge (q=q') \wedge (r=r') \wedge 
    (t=0 \Rightarrow p=p' \vee h=h')

    
\end{array}
\]

<p>
The attacker can learn more detailed information about 
\(h\).
</p>
<h3 id="toc_0.0.3">The Motivation</h3>
<p>
For the program which allows the declassification,
an passive attacker is allowed to observe 
some secret information.
But the declassification mechanism may be abused by the <em>Active attacker</em>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Active Attacks</strong>: attackers are able to change the behavior of the executing
system. For example, in a system that is a single-computer program, the
attacker might overwrite memory locations or registers of the machine.
</p>
 
<p>
<strong>Passive Attacks</strong>: attacker can make(perhaps limited) observations of the system
and draw inference from those observations.
</p>

<p>
Take the following program,
</p>

<p>
if (user = iuser &amp;&amp; passwd = ipasswd) {
</p>
<blockquote>
output_to_public ("login on OK")
</blockquote>
<p>
} else {
</p>
<blockquote>
output_to_public ("login on fail")
</blockquote>
<p>
}
</p>

<p>
The program just leak the <em>user</em> and <em>passwd</em> to the public.
But if the attacker(<em>Active Attacker</em>) can change the state of the program.
for example, add the statement <em>passwd:=h</em> where \(h\) is secret.
Then some information about \(h\) is leaked.
</p>

<p>
The goal for the <em>Robust Declassification</em> is to ensure that 
an active attacker cannot get more information than the 
passive attacker.
</p>


<h3 id="toc_0.0.4">About Declassification</h3>
<p>
The starting point for the notion of declassification is that any system that leaks
information -- any system that does not satisfy \(SP(\approx)\) -- can be thought
of as containing declassifications.
A passive attacker may be able to learn some information by observing the system
but, by assumption, that information leakage is allowed by the security policy.
