<p>
When you need to give a speech in the public,
and you don't have any experience,
don't know how to present a good powerpoint,
don't know how to organize your presentation,
don't know how to clarify your ideas clearly,
don't know how to attract the audiences,
don't know how to start the first page of your powerpoint,
...
totally blank in the brain.
</p>

<p>
Then
you are inconfident,
and
you are
suspicious if you have the ability to complete it.
You start to be anxious,
start to be fearful about the close of the date of the speach,
start to be slack and have no interest to do anything,
start to sense no happiness and no spirite,
</p>

<p>
Life start to be dark.
</p>

<p>
What can you do?
</p>

<p>
continue to be depressed and escape the speech?
</p>

<p>
No, never!
</p>

<p>
What you just need is to start to prepare the presentation
right now.
</p>

<p>
One page,
One word.
</p>

<p>
Whatever it is, it will be really really great presentation,
because it is done by yourself,
and you can prove that you have the ability to have a presentation.
Maybe it is not so handsome, you can do it.
</p>



<p>
Then add more pages when you think about more words.
You start to aware  that you start to adjust the sentence to
make it more good-hearing.
</p>

<p>
Nice!
</p>

<p>
You start to consider how to make your presentation more sumptuous.
</p>

<p>
step by step
</p>

<p>
your presentation turns to be more and more perfect.
</p>

<p>
You never feel anxious.
You start to anticipate the speech.
You prove that your capable to give a nice speech.
