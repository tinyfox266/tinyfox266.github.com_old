My purpose is to design some policy to solute the practical problems
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Identify the policy I am looking for

<ul>
<li>
figure out what the policy looks like.

<li>
figure out that does the policy mean.

<li>
figure out how user can use the policy(change the mind thought into
          formal policy).

</ul>
<li>
find some practical examples to justify this policy is useful.

<li>
design a method to enforce this policy     

</ul>
    
<p>
My policy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
policy 1

<ul>
<li>
h_1 and h_2 can not be both released.

<ul>
<li>
h_1 \/ h_2

<li>
h_1 and h_2 can not be both released.

<li>
if h_1 and h_2 should not be released both, then the policy should be
          like h_1 \/ h_2

</ul>
<li>
Example (We just consider two levels here)

<ul>
<li>
In the laboratory, only one of the full professors is femal. So we can
          find out her salary with just two queries: 'Average salary professors?'
          and 'Average salary male professors?'

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
assume that the laboratory contains n members, 
with the salaries are s1,...,sn: 
s1 ... s(n-1) are male's salaries, sn is the only female's salary.
And non-individual member's salary can be released.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
If the Average salaries of professors(e1 = (s1+...+sn)/n) and 
the Average salaries of male professors (e2 = (s1+...+s(n-1))/(n-1))
can be released, then the salary of the female professor can be
calculated with e1*n - e2*(n-1) if n is public.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
So the policy can be set as (s1+...+sn) \/ (s1+...+s(n-1)).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Actually this policy cannot prevent an attacker 
from getting the salary of the female when he requests e1 in the
first run can requests e2 in the second run.
</blockquote>
          
<ul>
<li>
Consider such a game, there are nine covered cards which contains a
          King on the table.
          Two players revealed one card in turn in each round.
          The one who revealed the King will win.
          We should ensure that only one card can be revealed by one player at each round.

</ul>
<blockquote>
So the policy for the function play(int i) can be set as forall 0&lt;=i&lt;9.\/ card[i]
can be as follows:
</blockquote>

<pre>
              int card[9];
              int x;
              int continue=0;
              main () {
                  for (int i=0; i&lt;9; i++)
                    card[i] = random(1,13);
                  card[random(0,8)] = 13;
                  for (int i=0; i&lt;9 &amp;&amp; continue; i++) {
                    input x;
                    continue= play(x);
                  }
              
              }
                
              int play(int i) {
                  if (i &lt;0 || i &gt; 9)
                    return;
                  if (card[i] == 13) {
                    output 'win'
                    return 0;
                  }  else {
                    output card[i];
                    return 1;
                  }
              }
</pre>


<ul>
<li>
policy 2

<ul>
<li>
h_1 can be released only after h_2 is released(also called release in
      multiple steps).

<ul>
<li>
h_1 --&gt; h_2  

<li>
h_2 cannot be released before h_1

</ul>
<li>
