<h2 id="toc_0.1">The Problem of Trusted Processes</h2>
<p>
Firstly, the <em>Trusted Process</em> is needed.
That is to say that 
if the kernel enforces and obey a single, system-wide security policy, then
there must be certain system functions cannot be accommodated with its
discipline.
A line-printer spooler provides a simple example of such a function:
if the spooler and its spool files are at the highest security classification,
then users of more lowly classification cannot inspect their own spool
files -- even for the innocent purpose of discovering the progress of their jobs.
For this reason, it is usual for spool files to be classified at the level of
their owners while the spooler continues to run at the highest level so that it
may read spool files of all classifications. But then the spooler cannot delete
spool files after their contents have been printed -- for such action conflicts
with the (kernel enforced) *-property of multilevel security.
In order to provide an acceptable user interface, while avoiding the
proliferation of used spool files, it seems necessary that the spooler should
become a 'trusted process' and be allowed to violate the *-property.
</p>

<p>
In real systems there are many functions which require the privileges of trusted
processes in order to evade or override the security controls normally enforced
by the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Once trusted processes are admitted to the system, however, the kernel is no
longer the sole arbiter of security; it is necessary to be sure that the special
privileges granted to trusted processes are not abused by those processes and
may not be usurped by other, untrusted, processes.
In order to guarantee security, therefore, we must verify the whole of the
'trusted computing base' -- that is, the combination of kernel and trusted
processes. The difficulty is that existing formal models do not provide a basis
for the verification of this combination. Even for the <em>Bell-LaPadula Model</em>
which includes trusted processes.
</p>

<p>
The true roots of the difficulties caused by trusted processes are not to be
found in those processes themselves, nor in the functions which then perform,
but in the conception that a security kernel should act as a centralized agent
for the enforcement of a uniform system-wide security policy.
We should seek a system structure that allows each component to make its own
contribution to the security of the overall system and that treats all
contributions equally.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.2">Separation Kernel</h2>
<p>
The task of a separation kernel is to create an environment which is
indistinguishable from that provided by a physically distributed system:
it must appear as if each regime is a separate, isolated machine and that
information can only flow from one machine to another along known external
communications lines.
</p>

<p>
Properties should be proved of a separation kernel:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
There are no channels for information flow between regimes other than those
  explicitly provided. 

<ul>
<li>
The problem can be simplified in this way:
    if we cut the communication channels that are allowed, then provided there are
    no illicit channels present, the components of the system will become
    completely isolated from one another. 
    It remains to discover how to 'cut' communication lines that are not physical
    wires but properties of the kernel software.

<li>
Since communication in software is accomplished by the use of shared
    objects, for example regimes A and B use the shared object X to communicate,
    then if we replace all of A's references to X by references to a new object,
    X1, and all of B's references to X by references to a new object, X2,
    then this is equivalent to 'cutting' the communication channel represented
    by X.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
The difference between <em>Separation Kernel(SK)</em> and <em>Virtual Machine Monitor(VMM)</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
There is no requirement for SK to provide VMs which are exact copies of the
  base hardware(or even for all the VMs to be a like).

<li>
There is a requirement for SK to provide communications channels between some
  of its VMs.

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_0.3">Proof of Separability</h2>
<p>
The purpose of a separation kernel is to simulate a distributed environment. To
the software in each regime, the environment provided by a separation kernel
should be indistinguishable from that of an isolated machine dedicated to its
private use. This imaginary private machine is called 'abstract machine' for
that regime, while the single, shared system that is actually available is
called the 'concrete' machine.  What we desire, for security, is that each
regime's view of the concrete machine should exactly coincide with its own
abstract machine.
</p>

<p>
There are six conditions for 'Proof of Separability':
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Regime which is currently 'active' on the concrete machine cannot distinguish
  its actual environment from that of its abstract machine.
  That is to say, an action 'COP' operates on the concrete machine will lead to
  the same result with that action's abstraction operates on the abstract
  machine. Its idea is similar with the method to verify the correction of a data
  type.

<li>
Execution of a concrete operation on behalf of the active regime should not
  affect the state of the machine perceived by currently 'inactive' regimes.
  That is to say, the regime will step to the same result no matter what
  operations the other regimes has done in the period.

<li>
Because I/O devices can directly observe and change aspects of the concrete
  machine's internal state(by reading and writing its device registers, for
  example),and also influence its instruction sequencing mechanism(by raising
  interrupts), the activity of these devices is relevant to security.
  Consequently, we must impose conditions on their behaviour.  
  Assume RED is a regime and REDABS maps concrete state to RED's abstract state.

<ol>
<li>
If REDABS(X)=REDABS(Y) and activity by a RED I/O device  changes the state
    of the concrete machine from X to X', and the same activity will also change
    it from Y to Y', then REDABS(X')=REDABS(Y')(i.e., state changes in the RED
    regime caused by RED I/O activity must depend only on the activity itself
    and the previous state of the RED regime).

<li>
If activity by a non-RED I/O device changes the state of the concrete
    machine from X to Y, then REDABS(X)=REDABS(Y)(i.e., non-RED I/O devices
    cannot change the state of the RED regime).

<li>
If REDABS(X)=REDABS(Y), the any outputs produced by RED I/O devices must be
    the same in both cases.

<li>
If REDABS(X)=REDABS(Y), then the next operations executed on behalf of the
    RED regime must also be the same in both cases.
