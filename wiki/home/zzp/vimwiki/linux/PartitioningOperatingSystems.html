<h1 id="toc_1">Partitioning Operating Systems Versus Process-based Operating Systems</h1>
<h2 id="toc_1.1">Partitioning operating systems</h2>
<p>
In a partitioning operating systems, memory(and possibly CPU time as well) is
divided among statically allocated paritions in a fixed manner. The idea is to
take a processor and make it pretend it is several processors by completely
isolating the subsystems.
</p>

<p>
Hard partitions are set up for each part of the system, and each has certain
amount of memory(and potentially a time slice) allocated to it.
Each partition is forever limited to its initial fixed memory allocation, which
can neither be increased nor decreased after the initial system configuration.
</p>

<p>
Within each partition may be multiple threads or processes, or both, if the
operating system supports them. How these threads are scheduled depends on the
implementation of the OS. A partition will generally support a separate
namespace to enable multi-programming by mapping the program into the partition.
</p>

<p>
If the operating system supports time partitioning, it too is fixed.
For example, in an ARINC 653 partitioning system with just three partitions and
a total major allocation of 100ms per cycle, a fixed cyclic scheduler could be
set to run the first partition for 20ms, then the second partition for 30ms, and
then the third for 50ms.
</p>

<p>
LynxOS-178 is an 
<a href="http://www.lynuxworks.com/solutions/milaero/arinc-653.php ">ARINC 653 partitioning operating system</a> 
that supports 
<a href="http://www.lynuxworks.com/products/posix/processes.php3">multiple POSIX processes</a>
and multiple address spaces; priority scheduling; priority inheritance; and
priority ceilings within each partition. LynxOS-178 essentially moves the LynxOS
scheduler and operating system up a level into each partition, with a full ARINC
653 partitioning operating system underneath.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.2">Partitions versus process-understanding the difference</h2>
<p>
Partitioning Operating Systems are powerful when it is necessary to completely
isolate portions of the system from each other. 
For example, the activities of the CPU in a plane's cockpit control system must
be perdictable and known at all times, and the fixed, cyclic nature of a
partitioning operating system's scheduler makes this possible. Without fixed
time-slice partitioning, a rate monotonic analysis would need to be performed to
know exactly where a system is executing.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, a global,thread-scheduler, process-based operating system best
serves the requirements of a system with an I/O device that could burst, such as
a radar system. Such a system must be capable of responding to bursting hardware
with all the system resources available. This can only be achieved by denying
processing time to other parts of the system, which would not be permitted under
a partitioning operating system and its unmodifiable processing-time allotments.
