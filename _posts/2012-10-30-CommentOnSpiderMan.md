Today, I review the movie *Spider-Man*.
I am really excited when I saw Petter aquire the super-power accidently.
Sometimes, I really hoped that I can get the super ability to change my
situation where I have been so long. Or may be there is the huge potential power
in the body and has not been discovered yet. If the hidden power is found,
maybe our life will turn to be really different, and we will be some body.
So I really understand the excited feeling of Petter. Petter is no longer the
weak clumsy student ever since, and is never affraid of anybody or ashamed of
himself. 

After turning strong, Peter starts to be arrogant. He starts to fight in school,
starts to argue with his uncle and hurt his uncle's heart.
He is never the docile and shy body.
He starts to use his
power to earn money.

The impressive words:

Uncle Ban: I know I am not your father.

Peter: Then do not pertend to be.

Robber: Give a chance.

Perter: My uncle, did you give him a chance.

Unclue Ban: With greater power, comes with greater responsibility.
